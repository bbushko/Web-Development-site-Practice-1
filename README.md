# Web-Development-site-Practice-1
My first practice with real project. I found the page .psd layout online, and decided to recreate it from scratch. It is a good opportunity to try out my Flexbox knowledge. Next project I'll maybe practice with grids.

Link to the layout's site: https://camouf.ru/designes/ready-psd-layouts-for-saito/7836.html

Try to enjoy looking this page's code! :)
